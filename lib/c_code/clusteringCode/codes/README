The directory examples/ contains basic usage examples of the MySQL Connector/C++.

In order to compile and run them you must have a MySQL server installed. 
By default the examples will try to connect to a MySQL server on the host 
"127.0.0.1" at port "3306" using the username "root" and the password "root".
You can change the connection properties in example.h

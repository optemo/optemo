- Implement non-differential non-hierarchical cluster label generation
  algorithms, where the cluster labels are sets of keywords.
- Implement differential non-hierarchical cluster label generation
  algorithms, where the cluster labels are sets of keywords.

These two kinds of algorithms should be relatively easy to implement.

Each camera has an associated set of reviews, so that each camera is a
cluster of review documents. Cluster labels for a single camera can be
based on word occurrence within that reviews for that camera.

A non-leaf cluster is a combination of smaller clusters. The parent
cluster's labels can be generated by combining the word occurrence
counts of the smaller clusters.

- Implement the Glover & Pennock algorithm in the paper "Inferring
  Hierarchical Descriptions".
  - Does this algorithm only find cluster labels for an
  already-existing cluster hierarchy or does it also build the cluster
  hierarchy?
  - This algorithm involves cutoff value parameters that will have to
  be tuned.

- Implement the Treeratpituk algorithm in the paper "Automatically
  Labeling Hierarchical Clusters".
  - This algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm and so it
  requires training data. It is basically an extension of the Glover &
  Pennock algorithm that does not require parameter tuning. It's a
  tradeoff between tuning parameters and finding a training data set.
  - The 'descriptive score' used for ranking keywords in this
  algorithm is a linear combination of other scoring functions. The
  supervised learning portion of the algorithm is used to determine
  the coefficients of the linear combination used. It does not look
  like it is used anywhere else.
  - It sounds like the training dataset can be generated by performing
  cluster labelling using some other algorithm and then computing the
  descriptive scores based on the resulting cluster labelling, but
  it's not clear how to do this.

- Implement Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or find a way of using
  the MATLAB implementation.
  - LDA is simply a means of computing a set of topics and a
  mulitnomial over topics for each document. The document multinomials
  over a cluster are then averaged to generate the cluster labels.

- Implement ideas for sets of keyphrases as cluster labels.
- Implement ideas for descriptive sentences as cluster labels.
- Talk to Hammad about his work on multi-document summaries for ideas?

- Implementation of product-review-informed cluster algorithms.

Evaluation of cluster labels
There needs to be some way of automatically rating the suitability of
the cluster labels. The "Reading Tea Leaves" paper from NIPS 2009
might give some good insight and references on how to do this and
whether Mechanical Turk tasks might be a better way of rating cluster
labels.

There may not be much use in implementing cluster-internal labeling
algorithms because the most common words are ones like "camera", "not"
and "good". These would not be very useful as cluster labels.

It might be worthwhile to explore the option of using the summary of
ones of the reviews in the cluster as the label for the entire
cluster.

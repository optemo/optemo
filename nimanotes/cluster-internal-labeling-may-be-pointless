There may not be much use in implementing cluster-internal labeling
algorithms because the most common words are ones like "camera", "not"
and "good". These would not be very useful as cluster labels.

It might be worthwhile to explore the option of using the summary of
one of the reviews in the cluster as the label for the entire
cluster. The review whose summary is used could be the one that is
closest to the centroid of all of the reviews in the cluster.

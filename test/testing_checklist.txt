    - Click on the next page link (arrow); Go back by clicking the previous page link
    - Click on the number 2; make sure this is the same page you switched to before
  - Find a product with other available colours or bundles displayed underneath. 
    - Hover over a sibling color swatch to check the alt text
    - Click a sibling or bundle to see if it leads to the right product page
  - Click 'on sale' and then undo it to see if it works
  - Filter brands by clicking on one, then multiple brand check boxes

    - Repeat the previous step for a couple of other colours
  - Sliders:
    - Check that there are distribution graphs on top of the sliders
    - Check that the default setting is the entire range
    - For each slider, check that the number of products / slider distributions change when the sliders are set to different values
    - Check the behaviour at the slider extremities
      - Do all the products show up if you manually reset the slider after having used it, eg: move the one end of the slider, let the new page load, then move it back to its original position
  - Categories:
    - Click a couple and see if they update the products available
    - Check that brand filters are sorted alphabetically
    - Check that no more than 10 filters appear; if there are more than 10, then the link "More" should appear instead
  - Check two brands, then click on a binary filter with a small number
    - Undo the filter. Test the cases where the filter matched:
      - Both brands: undoing it will preserve the two brands.
      - One brand: only the matched brand stays selected. (As of 10/10, this does not pass. Both brands stay selected.)
  - Check a couple of binary filters then uncheck them (both in status and advanced search)
    - Click on both the link and the box
    - Check that the proper products are shown
  - Dynamic ranges by product type
    - select a subcategory that should have dynamic ranges behavior, e.g. internal hard drives in hard drives
      - check whether for range filters other than price e.g. capacity for hard drives, the min/max of the range buckets change with the subcategory.
      - check that the number of results in the ranges is also updated and different from the landing page
    - apply several filters and select product type subcategories, select a couple ranges, and click "Undo" to remove applied filters
      - check that all the different types of filters can be undone
      - check that the user's selection is not changed (e.g. a selected range shouldn't disappear even if it's got zero results in a subcategory)
      - look for inconsistencies
  - On FutureShop, click Clear Selections, then See all
    - Clear Selections should not appear if no filters are selected
  - Click on the Add to Cart link and see if it works
  - Check layout:
    - "Your Selections" area:
      - if no filters are selected the area should not appear at all
      - check that selected filters appear in this area in the same order as the facets appear, and in the same categories
        - check several different facets and make sure they appear properly
        - colour should be a word, not a coloured box like in the facets
        - each should have an "undo" button. Check that this works
  - Check headers:
    - Select filters that have a small number of results so that as many filters as possible disappear. Check that the filters and the headers for these sections are not shown (i.e. Advanced Search, etc.) when there are 0 results
  - Back/forward button:
    - Select a filter, change the sorting order, then change the page.
      - Verify the back button correctly undoes all these actions.

French:

  - Check that titles are French. 
  - Check that links go to French PDPs
  - Check that the copy and units are all French
  - Check that the numbers are formatted in French ($ after the amount, ',' as a decimal separator)

EHF: 
  BB and FS laptops should show EHF in prices when regionCode is QC.
  - to set this up, in Firebug, edit the regionCode cookie value to be "QC", then reload the page
    - look under the price in the navbox and in the compare page for the price breakdown
    - check that the price filter facet / slider is shown and its values match the total price
    - sort by price and check that the results make sense
  
After changes to the update task:  
  - Compare live site to sandbox once the update task has been run on Jaguar for production
  - Things that break easily and should be checked:
    - Product numbers
      - Confirm that the total products for each department match
      - Confirm that the filter product numbers (i.e. Waterproof (7)) match
      - If products are missing, check the database for them and their specs
        - If they are missing from the database, it's probably a scraping error
        - If they appear in the database but not on the site, it's probably a Solr error
    - Sorting
      - Try one of the price sorting options and confirm it works
        - If not, this is probably due to an error in the Solr index process
    - In stock/Out of stock products
      - Look for products whose images aren't clickable and whose text fields aren't links
        - These appear when a product is indexed in Solr but is listed as out of stock in the database, so there may be a problem with the index process
  - Check the first page of each department on sandbox against the live site with the same options set (the easiest is to set no filters and to choose a price-sorting option)
    - Make sure products appear in the same order, with the same names, same images, same prices, etc.

Excellent battery life even though they are AA\'s, but that being said there is something about being able to run to the local shop and get new ones when you out on vacation or a shoot. Amazing zoom capability and clarity. I have traveled the world with this camera now and there is something to be said for being able to get the shoot you want from a distance. You will love this one. The SX30IS will probably be a good choice too.","submissionTime": "December 20, 2010","reviewerName": "Patrick McVeigh","reviewerLocation": "Trenton, Ontario"},{"rating": 5.00,"ratingAttributes":{},"title": "GREAT CAMERA","comment": "I LIKE THE PICTURE QUALITY ONLY THING THAT I DONT LIKE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE LENSE COVER OFF AND THERE IS NO WAY TO ATTACH WITH THE CAMERA. \r\nOVERALL GREAT BUY GOOD PICTURE AND DESIGN.","submissionTime": "December 1, 2010","reviewerName": "RAMAN","reviewerLocation": "TORONTO"},{"rating": 1.00,"ratingAttributes":{},"title": "Canon Powershot SX20IS 12.1MP","comment": "This is a very good camera it is so easy to use .

Image stabilizer is not as good as expected. noticeble shaking of image is shown when filming at tele zooming. \r\nall in all, an excellent camera for taking photo, but if you are a fan of filming, better to get a camcorder.","submissionTime": "November 26, 2010","reviewerName": "shawn","reviewerLocation": "Markham"},{"rating": 5.00,"ratingAttributes":{},"title": "Canon SX 20 is","comment": "Like some of the other posts i spent most of the winter comparing this camera to its closest rival and due to alot of the features and reviews on this model from experts decided to get it in April.

I checked out lots of reviews and settled on the Canon SX20 is.  Shots of a swallow in a tree had superb sharpness and image quality.  On some other shots zoomed in at 80x you can still make out people\'s faces from about 1/4 mile away. \r\n\r\nPros: Fun to use Camera. Excellent picture and movie quality. Amazing 20x + 4x digital zoom feature.\r\n\r\nCons: Not able to get close enough for macro shots in zoom mode.  About 1 second delay between pictures.  Lens hood does not lock on tight enough and easily twists off.\r\n\r\nOther than the few inconveniences I highly recommend this camera and think it is an excellent choice for price vs quality.","submissionTime": "April 3, 2010","reviewerName": "GM","reviewerLocation": "Sherbrooke, Quebec"},{"rating": 4.00,"ratingAttributes":{},"title": "Great Camera","comment": "I bought this camera about a week ago and LOVE it For the most part it takes great pictures and I love that I also have the opportunity to take HD video as well.

<p><b><u>All-Purpose:</u></b> As the category suggests, you can find a large variety of versatile printers here.  
<b><u>Home Office:</u></b> If you're working from home you may find that your physical space is perhaps limited. Printers in this category are more compact and will fit easily into your office.
<b><u>Small Office:</u></b> Laserprinters in this category come equipped with a network print server.
<b><u>Corporate:</u></b> Printers pre-screened for corporate uses are veritable powerhouses. They come equipped with a print server, larger paper tray, faster printing, and keep up easily with the fast turnaround pace necessary for a corporate setting.
<b><u>Photography:</u></b> All printers in the photography category have high resolution (1200x600 dpi and above!).

The Optemo Services, including all content, are provided without any warranties, expresses or implied.

<h2>Limitation of Liability </h2>
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither Optemo nor its licensors and service providers involved in the creation and delivery of the Optemo Services shall be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary and punitive damages resulting from your use or misuse of and reliance on the Optemo Services, from inability to access and use, the Optemo Services, whether such claim is based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, even if Optemo or its licensors and service providers have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Further more, you specifically acknowledge that Optemo is not liable for the defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct of the other users or third parties and that the risk of injury from the foregoing rests entirely with you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the British Columbia, without regard to its conflict of law provisions or your actual state or country of residence. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of the Terms of Service to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service will remain in full force and effect. 
<h2>Entire Agreement </h2>
These Terms of Use constitutes the entire agreement between you and Optemo with respect to the Optemo Services. These Terms of Service supersede and replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding the Optemo Services.
